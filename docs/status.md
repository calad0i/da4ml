# Project Status

da4ml is currently **beta** software and is under active development. Its core functionality is stable, but some features/API regarding tracing individual operations may change in future releases. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community through issues and pull requests.

It is adviced to always verify the results produced from the generated code.

## Supported Operations

Most common high-level operations can be represented in [DAIS](dais.html) is supported, including but not limited to:
 - Dense/Convolutional/EinsumDense layers
 - ReLU
 - max/minimum of two tensors; max/min pooling
 - element-wise addition/subtraction/multiplication
 - rearrangement of tensors (reshape, transpose, slicing, etc.)
 - fixed-point quantization
 - Arbitrary unary mapping through logic lookup tables (no to be confused with LUT primitives)


## Unsupported Operations
 - Anything requires stateful operations/time dependencies: due to the SSA nature of DAIS, we do not plan to support stateful operations (e.g., not-unrolled RNNs) within the da4ml framework. We believe these operations shall be implemented in higher-level frameworks that orchestrate the DAIS programs.
 - Bit-exact integer division: We do not support real division or bit-exact integer division. Users are advised to approximate division with multiplication and inverse table lookup where necessary.
